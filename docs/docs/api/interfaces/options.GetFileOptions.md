[options](../modules/options.md).GetFileOptions

Use this method to get basic information about a file and prepare it for
downloading. For the moment, bots can download files of up to 20MB in size. On
success, a File object is returned. The file can then be downloaded via the link
https://api.telegram.org/file/bot[token]/[file_path], where [file_path] is taken
from the response. It is guaranteed that the link will be valid for at least 1
hour. When the link expires, a new one can be requested by calling getFile again.
Note: This function may not preserve the original file name and MIME type. You
should save the file's MIME type and name (if available) when the File object is received.
