/**
 * Use this method to get basic information about a file and prepare it for
 * downloading. For the moment, bots can download files of up to 20MB in size. On
 * success, a File object is returned. The file can then be downloaded via the link
 * https://api.telegram.org/file/bot<token>/<file_path>, where <file_path> is taken
 * from the response. It is guaranteed that the link will be valid for at least 1
 * hour. When the link expires, a new one can be requested by calling getFile
 * again.
 * Note: This function may not preserve the original file name and MIME type. You
 * should save the file's MIME type and name (if available) when the File object is
 * received.
 * @see {@link https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getfile}
